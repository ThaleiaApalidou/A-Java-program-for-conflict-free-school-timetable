# A-Java-program-that-builds-a-conflict-free-weekly-school-timetable
This project implements a Java application that automatically generates a conflict-free weekly timetable for a middle school using a genetic algorithm.
The input of the program are two XML files, one for teachers' information and one for the coarses.
Each chromosome is modeled as a 3D array where the dimensions correspond to class, day, and hour, and each cell contains the subject and the assigned teacher.
